# snapjunkmail

This application will acts as a
- SMTP Server
- Web Client to retrieve mail

Sound no special ? Yes, but there is no registration required ! 
That's mean you can just user@xxxx.com to receive email.

Extremely good if you need to create tons of mail for testing or other purpose you named it.
